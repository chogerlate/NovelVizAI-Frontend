# Novel Companion AI - API Integration Summary

## Overview

The Novel Companion AI application has been successfully updated to integrate with the FastAPI backend, transforming it from a static JSON file-based system to a dynamic, real-time API-driven application. This integration enables real-time novel analysis, interactive chat capabilities, and seamless file uploads.

## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. API Client Integration

**New Components Added:**
- `NovelCompanionAPI` class: Complete API client with comprehensive error handling
- `config.py`: Centralized configuration management
- Request timeout and connection management
- Session-based HTTP client for improved performance

**API Endpoints Integrated:**
- `GET /api/novels/` - List available novels with search and filtering
- `GET /api/novels/{novel_id}` - Get specific novel details
- `GET /api/novels/{novel_id}/chapters` - Retrieve chapters for a novel
- `GET /api/novels/{novel_id}/characters` - Get character information
- `POST /api/upload/` - Upload novel files for analysis
- `POST /api/novels/{novel_id}/chat` - Interactive chat about novels
- `POST /api/chapters/{chapter_id}/summarize` - Generate chapter summaries

### 2. Data Flow Transformation

**Before (JSON Files):**
```
Local JSON files → Direct loading → Static analysis display
```

**After (API Integration):**
```
API Backend → Dynamic data fetching → Real-time analysis → Interactive features
```

### 3. Enhanced User Interface

**Dynamic Novel Selection:**
- Real-time novel discovery from the API
- Chapter selection based on available data
- Live statistics and metrics display

**Improved File Upload:**
- Direct integration with backend processing
- Real-time upload status and feedback
- Support for multiple file formats

**Enhanced Chat Functionality:**
- Real-time AI responses from the backend
- Context-aware conversations about novels
- Fallback responses for robust user experience

### 4. Configuration Management

**New Configuration System:**
```python
# config.py
API_BASE_URL = os.getenv("API_BASE_URL", "http://localhost:8000")
API_TIMEOUT = 30
MAX_CHAT_MESSAGES = 50
```

**Environment Variables Support:**
- `API_BASE_URL`: Configure backend API location
- Flexible deployment across different environments
- Easy local development and production deployment

### 5. Error Handling & Resilience

**Comprehensive Error Management:**
- API connection status checking
- Graceful degradation when API is unavailable
- User-friendly error messages
- Fallback responses based on available data

**Performance Optimization:**
- HTTP session reuse for improved performance
- Request timeouts to prevent hanging
- Chat history management to control memory usage

## Technical Architecture

### API Client Structure

```python
class NovelCompanionAPI:
    def __init__(self):
        self.base_url = API_BASE_URL
        self.timeout = API_TIMEOUT
        self.session = requests.Session()
    
    # Novel management
    def get_novels(self, search=None, author=None)
    def get_novel_by_id(self, novel_id)
    def get_novel_chapters(self, novel_id)
    def get_novel_characters(self, novel_id)
    
    # File operations
    def upload_novel_file(self, file_content, filename, title, author)
    
    # Interactive features
    def chat_about_novel(self, novel_id, message)
    def summarize_chapter(self, chapter_id, summary_length)
```

### Session State Management

**Enhanced Session Variables:**
- `current_novel_id`: Tracks selected novel
- `current_chapter_id`: Tracks selected chapter
- `chat_history`: Managed conversation history
- `api_connected`: Connection status indicator

### Data Conversion Layer

**API Response Mapping:**
```python
def convert_api_chapter_to_analysis(chapter: Dict, novel_id: str) -> Dict:
    # Converts API chapter data to analysis format
    # Maintains compatibility with existing UI components
    # Provides structured data for visualizations
```
